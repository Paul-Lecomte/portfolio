# Portfolio 2025

Welcome to my 2025 personal portfolio, where I've reimagined the traditional portfolio layout into a Windows 11-inspired desktop environment. This project showcases my skills as a developer while offering a unique, interactive, and immersive experience. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the app mimics a desktop UI complete with resizable windows, a taskbar, a file explorer, and a dynamic system for navigating through different pages and projects.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Interactive Desktop UI:** Explore my portfolio through a dynamic, desktop-like interface that mimics Windows 11.
- **Resizable Windows:** Open and resize windows, just like on a real desktop, to view different sections of the portfolio.
- **File Explorer:** A working file system that allows you to navigate through directories, open files, and interact with content like you would on a computer.
- **Taskbar:** A taskbar at the bottom allows quick access to the most important sections of the site.
- **State Management:** Utilizes **Zustand** for efficient state management to ensure smooth navigation and app functionality.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** Whether on desktop or mobile, the app adjusts seamlessly for optimal viewing and interaction.
- **Dark Mode with Neon Accents:** Stylish and modern aesthetics with a dark theme and neon accents for an exciting visual experience.
- **Page Navigation:** Easily navigate between different pages like **About**, **Projects**, **Settings**, and more through the desktop interface.

## ðŸŒ± Technologies Used

- **Next.js** â€“ A powerful React framework for building fast, server-rendered web applications.
- **TypeScript** â€“ Enhancing the development experience with static types for better maintainability and readability.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development, ensuring responsive, customizable designs.
- **Zustand** â€“ A minimal state management library for React that helps manage app state efficiently.
