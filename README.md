# Portfolio 2025

Welcome to my 2025 personal portfolio, where I've reimagined the traditional portfolio layout into a Windows 11-inspired desktop environment. This project showcases my skills as a developer while offering a unique, interactive, and immersive experience. Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, the app mimics a desktop UI complete with resizable windows, a taskbar, a file explorer, and a dynamic system for navigating through different pages and projects.
